Logging Levels
The numeric values of logging levels are given in the following table. These are
primarily of interest if you want to define your own levels, and need them to
have specific values relative to the predefined levels. If you define a level
with the same numeric value, it overwrites the predefined value; the predefined
name is lost.

Level	Numeric value
CRITICAL	50
ERROR	40
WARNING	30
INFO	20
DEBUG	10
NOTSET	0
